# Simple Trigger Bot for Valorant

## Introduction

This is a simple trigger bot implemented in C++ using the Windows API. It is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in any game, including Valorant, as it violates the terms of service and fair play principles of the game.

## Functionality

The trigger bot continuously checks for a trigger condition, which is typically the presence of an enemy player in the crosshairs. When the trigger condition is met, the bot simulates a mouse click to shoot.

## Usage

1. **Compile**: Compile the code using a C++ compiler. You can use Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler of your choice.

2. **Run**: After compiling, run the executable. The trigger bot will start monitoring for trigger conditions.

3. **Exit**: To exit the bot, simply close the console window or press `Ctrl+C`.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided for educational purposes only. The use of cheats or hacks in online games, including Valorant, is against the terms of service of the game and can result in severe penalties, including permanent bans. Respect the rules of the game and play fairly.
